# Week-1(Task-1 Introduction to the Program)

## 📘 Digital VLSI Planning in SoC Design

### Overview

Digital VLSI planning in System-on-Chip (SoC) design is the process of integrating processors, memory, interconnects, and peripherals on a single chip while meeting performance, power, and area goals.

### 🔑 Key Steps

- Specification – Define system functionality, performance, power, and area constraints.

- Architecture Design – Partition system into modules (IP cores, accelerators, buses/NoCs).

- RTL Design & Verification – Implement and validate logic before physical design.

* Physical Design Planning

  * Floorplanning & placement

  * Clock tree synthesis

  * Routing & timing closure

- Low-Power Techniques – Clock gating, power gating, multi-voltage domains.
- DFT (Design for Testability) – Ensure chip can be tested after faication.

- Sign-off & Tape-out – Final checks for timing, power, and manufacturability before fabrication.

### 🎯 Outcome

* Efficient SoC design that achieves:

  * High performance

  * Low power consumption

  * Optimized silicon area

  * Cost-effectiveness
