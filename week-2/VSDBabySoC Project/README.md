# VSDBabySoC

## Overview

**VSDBabySoC** is an open-source, mixed-signal System-on-Chip (SoC) designed to integrate digital and analog components on a single chip. It serves as an educational tool for understanding and implementing SoC designs, particularly in the context of **RISC-V architecture**.

**VSDBabySoC** is part of the VSD Hardware Design Program (HDP), which aims to provide hands-on experience in SoC design, from RTL (Register Transfer Level) to GDSII (Graphic Data System II). The project emphasizes the importance of integrating digital and analog components, offering insights into the challenges and solutions in mixed-signal design.

## Key Features

- **RVMYTH Processor**: A simple RISC-V-based CPU core developed by RedwoodEDA and VLSI System Design (VSD). It was introduced in workshops aimed at teaching SoC design concepts. 

- **8x Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)**: Generates a stable clock signal for the SoC, ensuring synchronized operation of digital components.

- **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**: Facilitates communication with analog devices by converting digital signals to analog form.

## Step-by-step Guide for Set-up

### RISC-V MYTH CORE

- Simulate the **RVMYTH core** using **IVerilog**.

- Observe and analyse the Waveforms using **GTKWave**.

### Waveform Analysis

- **Signals in the waveform**

   - `clk` → The clock is running at a constant frequency (high-frequency toggling, as expected).

   - `reset` → Held low (0), so the core is out of reset and running normally.

   - `out[9:0]` → This is the observed output bus of the RVMYTH core (10-bit wide).

- **Interpretation**

   - The waveform looks like a triangular / incremental-decremental sequence generated by the core. More specifically:
        - The values are counting down (0xA → 0x6 → 0x3 → 0x1 → 0x0),then counting up again (0x1 → 0x3 → 0x6 → 0xA → 0xF).
        
        - It demonstrates that the RVMYTH pipeline and ALU are working correctly (performing ADD/SUB operations to generate the sequence).
        
        - Since out[9:0] is only 10 bits wide, larger numbers are truncated, but here the values are small (within 0x00–0x0F range).


- **What it tells about the RVMYTH core**

   - The core is executing its sample program (typically a Fibonacci or triangular number generator loaded into instruction memory in the MYTH workshops).
   
   - The progression of values confirms:
        - Instruction fetch/decode/execute pipeline is functioning.
        
        - Register updates and ALU arithmetic are correct.
        
        - The output port is properly mapped to the program’s result register.
