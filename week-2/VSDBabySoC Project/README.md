# VSDBabySoC

## Overview

**VSDBabySoC** is an open-source, mixed-signal System-on-Chip (SoC) designed to integrate digital and analog components on a single chip. It serves as an educational tool for understanding and implementing SoC designs, particularly in the context of **RISC-V architecture**.

**VSDBabySoC** is part of the VSD Hardware Design Program (HDP), which aims to provide hands-on experience in SoC design, from RTL (Register Transfer Level) to GDSII (Graphic Data System II). The project emphasizes the importance of integrating digital and analog components, offering insights into the challenges and solutions in mixed-signal design.

## Key Features

- **RVMYTH Processor**: A simple RISC-V-based CPU core developed by RedwoodEDA and VLSI System Design (VSD). It was introduced in workshops aimed at teaching SoC design concepts. 

- **8x Phase-Locked Loop (PLL)**: Generates a stable clock signal for the SoC, ensuring synchronized operation of digital components.

- **10-bit Digital-to-Analog Converter (DAC)**: Facilitates communication with analog devices by converting digital signals to analog form.

## Step-by-step Guide for Set-up

- First clone the Github Repository (https://github.com/kunalg123/rvmyth/)

- Then simulate the **RVMYTH core** using **IVerilog**.

- Observe and analyse the Waveforms using **GTKWave**.
